Variable annotations in Python allow you to provide type information for variables. This feature was introduced in Python 3.6, and it complements function annotations. Variable annotations are typically used to specify the expected type of a variable without initializing it.

# Variable Annotations in Python

## Introduction
Variable annotations in Python allow you to declare the type of a variable using a colon (:) followed by the type. This is separate from the actual variable assignment and can be used to provide type hints for variables.

Syntax

```bash
variable_name: type = initial_value
```
Example

```bash
name: str = "John"
age: int = 25
is_student: bool = False
```
## Use Cases
### Type Hints:
Variable annotations are primarily used for type hints. They provide information to developers and tools (like linters or type checkers) about the expected type of a variable.
### Documentation:
Variable annotations serve as a form of self-documentation in your code. They make it clear what type of data a variable is intended to hold.
### Static Type Checking:
Tools like MyPy can leverage variable annotations for static type checking. This helps catch type-related issues early in the development process.
### Usage with Functions
Variable annotations can also be used with function arguments and return types:

```bash
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

pi: float = 3.14
```
### Notes
Variable annotations are optional. If you don't provide an annotation, Python will infer the type dynamically.
Annotations are not enforced at runtime. They serve as hints and are primarily used for static analysis.
### Conclusion
Variable annotations in Python provide a way to add type hints to your code, improving readability and enabling static type checking. They contribute to the overall goal of making Python code more expressive and maintainable.
