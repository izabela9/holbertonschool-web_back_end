# ES6 data manipulation

ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) introduced several features that make data manipulation in JavaScript more concise and expressive. Here are some of the key features and techniques for data manipulation in ES6:

1. Arrow Functions:
* Arrow functions provide a concise syntax for writing function expressions.
* They are particularly useful in functional programming and array methods.

2. Template Literals:
* Template literals allow embedding expressions inside string literals.
* This can be useful for creating dynamic strings.

3. Array Methods:
* ES6 introduced new array methods that simplify common operations on arrays.
* Examples include map, filter, reduce, and forEach.

4. Object Property Shorthand:
* When creating objects, ES6 allows you to use shorthand syntax for property assignment if the variable name matches the property name.

These features, among others introduced in ES6, enhance the readability and expressiveness of JavaScript code, making it more concise and easier to work with when manipulating data.
